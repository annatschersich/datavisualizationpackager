I decided to create a package for datavisualization because I really enjoy doing visualizations. I wanted to cover as much as possible of the possibilities of datavisualization with my package, therefore I created three functions for three different types of visualization: one function to create scatterplot with the corresponding regressionline, another function to create the boxplot with a line representing the mean and in order to also offer an animated option in my package, I decided to use a function that does an animated lineplot.
